A simple ```react-native``` application taht focuses on implementing ```react-native navigation``` as well as implementing CSS in a native environment

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To get set up and ready to edit and expand the application follow instructions on * [React Native]([https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)) official installation docs after having selected to use **React Native CLI** instead of expo in a **Linux** and **Android** combination

Note: I have opted out of using Android Studio emulator and instead use Genymotion but as long there is an emulator of some soerts running once you start compiling your app there should be no issues

### Installing

Assuming that react native cli install process is successfully completed download or clone the project into a folder of your choosing and after verifying that your emulator of choice is running from inside the root folder of the project run: 

```
react-native run-android
```

Once the app has been compiled it should open in your device.


## Deployment

For live deployment of the applicaiton you can refer to the official [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android) page that explains the process
